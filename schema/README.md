## Responsibilities

> ✅ This folder stores the project's data models, schemas, and architecture diagrams.
> All data models must be maintained in YAML format, regardless of the backend technology.

## Important Notes (optional)

> ⚠️ The YAML files here serve as the single source of truth for the project's data structure.
> Keep them up-to-date and consistent with the actual implementations.
> All data models must be strictly based on the schema.org reference.

## Best Practices (optional)

### 🔹 1. File Naming Convention  
All schema files must use kebab-case (e.g., `user-profile.yaml`, `order-item.yaml`).

### 🔹 2. Documentation  
Add comments in YAML files to describe the entity/schema being used, or to clarify complex fields and relationships.

## Other Considerations (optional)

### 🔹 1. Compatibility  
Ensure that all teams (backend, frontend, data) can easily access and use these YAML models.

### 🔹 2. Organization  
Each data model is organized in its own subfolder for better clarity and modularity.
